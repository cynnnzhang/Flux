            <p style="padding-top:115px;color:white;">England's capital is known for its rich collaboration between historic and contemporary architecture, as it reflects a culture of moving forward but still celebrating the past. As you walk through the cities bustling streets, you’ll stumble across beautiful moments where history and progress collide. </p>

Walk along the South Bank of the Thames from the Design Museum to the Royal Festival Hall or drive into the City along Mile End Road, particularly at night, and the Gherkin’s curving form constantly entertains and enlivens”

            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:70px;">TOWER BRIDGE</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:8px;padding-right:90px;">Tower Bridge is a <strong>bascule</strong> and suspension bridge that blends modern engineering with Victorian aesthetic. To allow traffic to flow through the River Thames, the two gothic style towers hold machines that lift two parts of the bridge. If you’re brave and not afraid of acrobatics, you can transverse the new glass-floor walkway to experience a spectacular birds eye view of the city.  </p>
            <h2 style="font-size:25px;margin-left:200px;margin-top:60px;">Bascule - </h1>
            <p style="width:900px;margin-left:325px;margin-top:-132px;">A bridge with a section that can be raised and lowered </p>
            <div class="box2">
                <h3 style="margin-top:-1px;margin-left:15px;">!fun fact!</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:-110px;">In 1954, a bus driver was awarded a medal for pressing on his accelerator pedal unnoticeably when the bridge was opening. The bus leapt over a 1 metre gap.</p>

            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:130px;">THE GHERKIN</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:2px;padding-right:100px;">If you don’t recognize 30 St. Mary Axe, often nicknamed the Gherkin, it looks like a stretched egg that tapers towards its apex. Its triangular panels reflect and refract light astoundingly to form a complex of colour and shade. Despite of its curved shape, there is surprisingly only one piece of curved glass at the very top. Standing in the tower gives you a breathtaking view that spans from the busy streets below to the open sky above. The 41st floor is a club room which offers a 360-degree panorama of the capital. Many say the Gherkin has a brain of its own, as it adapts in accordance with the weather. For example if the sun is shining, it cools itself down by adjusting the blinds. </p>
            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:290px;">TEMPERATE HOUSE CONSERVATORY</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">The Temperate House Conservatory located in Kew Gardens is the longest surviving Victorian glasshouse in the world, and just recently reopened after a 5 year restoration. Its elegant victorian style window fixtures and swirling staircase combines harmoniously with the rich greenery. Many of the 10,000 plants it houses are rare and endangered species. Architects from Donald Insall Associates chose a scheme of polychromatic stone colours for repainting to retain the structures original colourings. If you’d like a peaceful break from the bustling city centres, I highly recommend visiting the Temperate House. </p>
        
            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:185px;">THE SHARD</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">The Shard, a feat of architecture developed by Italian engineer Renzo Piano, is emblematic to a shard of glass. It is portrayed by several glass facets inclining inwards vertically into the sky, but never meeting. Buildings made of glass (I promise you that’s the last time I’ll say glass) are renowned to have poor energy efficiency due to their windows ineffectiveness at weatherizing. However, the Shards ventilated double skin facade reduces heat gain while permitting the maximum natural daylight. In case you were wondering, the Shard has mixed uses, complete with apartments, offices, a hotel and spa, retail areas, restaurants and observation galleries. Piano describes it as a ‘vertical city’.
