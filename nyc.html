            <p>New York City is home to a plethora of urbanistic design and architecture, ranging from classic red brick buildings to curving glass structures. In 1664, the British seized the city that was formerly called New Amsterdam, from the Dutch; They gave it a new name, New York City. In 1811, a plan for an orderly grid of streets and avenues was devised. Furthermore in 1885, it was agreed a five borough “Greater New York” would be formed. We know it today as full of hustle and heart, worshipping commerce as a religion, and growing nowhere but up. Being the largest city in the country and one of the most diverse, the Big Apple offers memorable experiences for everyone. </p>

                <h1 style="margin-left:200px;">BROOKLYN BRIDGE</h1>
                <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:2px;padding-right:90px;">After 14 years of construction and the tragic loss of its creator John Augustus Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge gloriously loomed over New York City’s East River, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. The job to oversee the suspension bridges construction was passed down to Robelings son. However, he later developed caisson disease and passed down the role to his wife Emily. Emily was one of the first women of her kind to showcase superior strength and courage supervising the project, overseeing workers, contractors, an unfriendly press, and greedy city politicians. The Roeblings intellectual equality and unprecedented knowledge about wired infrastructure are the reasons for the bridges high title and long standing, acting as a unification of Upper New York.</p>
                <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:90px;">GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL</h1>
                <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">The more than a century old transportation hub is both a cultural and a commercial epicentre that embodies the ascent of 19th century New York. The <strong>beaux-arts</strong> masterpiece contains the largest Tiffany watch face above the information desk, a blue sky across its domed ceiling, and sculptures of Hercules, Mercury, and Minerva in its exterior. With just one step into the main concourse and a peer at the miles of marble, you’ll experience the grandeur and opulence of the space.</p>
                <h2 style="width:200px;margin-top:110px;margin-left:-5px;line-height:30px;">Beaux-Arts Architecture</h2>
                <p style="margin-left:-20px; margin-top:-70px;width:200px;">An architectural style originated from France emphasizing realistic sculptural decoration along modern lines. In addition to the terminal, the New York Public Library is a prime example of the style. </p>

                <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:120px;">VIA 57 WEST</h1>
                <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:2px;padding-right:100px;">Danish architect Bjarke Ingels revelatory pyramid-like apartment building combines traditional New York high rises with European <strong>perimeter blocks</strong>. The building is arranged around a lush courtyard, featuring 80 newly planted trees and 47 species of native plant material. Ingels coordinated his designs with sustainability in mind. The energy-efficient building recycles 60 000 gallons of water a day, and it was built using responsibly forested wood. The metal cladding at the front of the building is punctured by openings that provide balconies for the residents. </p>
                <p style="width:900px;margin-left:-80px; margin-top:-40px;">A central space built up on all sides also described as a courtyard. Often they are used to bring charm and humanizing elements—such as gardens and plazas—into city apartment living. </p>
                <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:60px;">ONE WORLD TRADE CENTRE</h1>
                <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">The glass-and-steel architectural marvel is both a memorial and a testament to the rebirth of the city following the September 11 attacks. It sits adjacent to the World Trade Centre Memorial: two cubic voids with cascading water down all four sides. Before the half kilometre skyscraper was built, many agreed the site should not just speak to remembrance, but also speak to future and hope. Thus in 2014, the One World Trade Centre reclaimed the sky. Its strong steel structure is veiled in lustrous glass, refracting light to create a shimmering display. It’s octagonal crystalline shape and eight embossed stainless steel edges reminisce the reflective corners of the original towers. The 204 by 204 feet podium it rises from also reminisces the footprints of the former twin towers. </p>
