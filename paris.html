            <p style="padding-top:90px;">The City of Lights is brimming with architectural beauty having served for hundreds of years as a laboratory where pioneering architects test their new ideas. Visiting the historical city will allow you to grasp the presence of different time periods coexisting harmoniously in the cities Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Classical, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, and Contemporary architectural styles. After the adoption of Renaissance styles, the city branched off from uniformity, managing to strike a perfect balance between tradition and innovation. </p>

            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:30px;">EIFFEL TOWER</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:2px;padding-right:90px;">As I peered out of the window on the train to Paris, all I could think about was if the religiously photographed wrought iron tower would live up to my high expectations. This youtuber I watch said she literally burst into tears upon first sight of the monument. It’s named after French civil engineer Gustave Eiffel, who used wrought iron in opposed to stone, symbolising the Industrial Revolution. Although at the beginning it was seen by locals as the ugliest in Paris, it quickly became a beloved icon and a symbol of the city. I highly recommend you at least pay to hike to the second floor. You can endure a challenge by climbing the stairs on foot, or use the elevator. In addition to the scenic aerial view of the entire capital, I got to experience a heartfelt proposal. If you tour at night, you will even experience a sparkling light show produced by 20 000 luminous bulbs that line the tower. It occurs for 5 minutes every hour on the hour. You may still wonder if I believe the tower lives up to its high name. Well, let’s just say you have to see it yourself to understand. </p>
            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:150px;">THE LOUVRE</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:2px;padding-right:100px;">Formerly, the Louvre was a royal palace for several generations of Kings. After the French Revolution, it was converted into a museum open to the public. The incredible structural detail is inspired by Greek and Roman ideas and philosophies commonly featured in Renaissance styles. It’s full beauty is unexplainable in words. In 1981, newly elected French President Francois Mitterand's wished to transform cultural institutions throughout France. Thus, he enlisted Chinese American architect I.M. Pei to renovate the Louvre. Pei implemented the historic glass pyramid in the centre of the court to serve as the museums grand entry, and to create a central focal point that compliments the scale and design of the museum. To contextualize the pyramid and allow it’s modernity to mesh with the pre-existing classical architecture, Pei designed it to fall beneath a centre line so it wouldn't stick above rooftops. He also searched for the clearest glass that would not alter a viewers perception of color of the surrounding buildings. </p>
            <p style="padding-top:20px;width:600px;text-align:center;padding-left:210px;">“Formally, it is the most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre..., it is also one of the most structurally stable of forms, which assures its transparency, as it is constructed of glass and steel, it signifies a break with the architectural traditions of the past. It is a work of our time.”</strong>”

            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:195px;">CENTRE POMPIDOU</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">The centre of art, music, and learning, which was intended by the French government to establish the city as a ‘cultural mecca’ for generations to come, bears the name of French President George Pompidou. Having stood in the buildings glory myself, I have to say Times describes it best: “[Architects Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano’s] building was radical, futuristic and inside-out: a playful cacophony of periscope-style ducts and air vents, it looms against the Paris sky as if still under construction, while a tubular Plexiglas caterpillar of an escalator zigzags up its facade”. Every part of the experience, from riding the tube-encased elevator, to interpreting wacky sculptures and art, to gazing at the tip of the Eiffel Tower and all that surrounds, was spectacular. It was worth every euro I paid. </p>
            <h1 style="margin-left:200px;margin-top:160px;">FOUNDATION LOUIS VUITTON</h1>
            <p style="padding-left:200px;padding-top:5px;padding-right:100px;">When architect Frank Gehry was designing a new cultural complex to be built in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne Park, he was influenced by the fluidity and lightness of late 19th century glass and garden architecture. The curved building was given its character by the use of a method called glazing, a method that allows the material to be curved in accordance with milimetre specific requirements. In simpler terms, the glass could be sculpted to perfection. The Guardian describes it “as if caught in a violent storm, the <strong>sails</strong> flare open in places to reveal an inner world of white walls, sculpted like whipped meringue, and a dense thicket of steel struts and wooden beams that have been forced into improbable shapes”. I’ve heard many descriptions of what the piles of glass sails depict: a bird, a fish, a cloud, and even a crushed Louis Vuitton perfume bottle. It is open to your own interpretation. It houses a collection of modern and contemporary art and providing a platform for various cultural programs. </p>

    <p style="margin-top:-220px;margin-left:580px;width:600px;">The design element that works in the fourth dimension - <i>time</i>. Architects often incorporate illusions into their designs to depict the appearance of a structure in motion. The <strong>sails</strong> give the Foundation Louis Vuitton its sense of movement. </p>
